A notes page for a tabletop game in the system of [A Song of Ice and Fire](https://greenronin.com/sifrp/)

**OF NOTE**: I have not interacted with the Game of Thrones universe and lore outside of this game, I am purposefully going in very blind. Things may be plain wrong or different than official lore due to deviations. We are playing before the main events of the show/books.
