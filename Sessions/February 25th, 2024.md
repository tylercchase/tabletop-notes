Keeping Mago on ship for now (oarsman dude we picked up from a shipwreck)

Approaching Asshai
Days getting shorter and shorter
Basically night-time
Only adults here (no kids born here)
Low population
City stretches for leagues
But like 1/10 actually has people in it
Stone super dark

Bought some cool masks
Not much crime here

Reavers in the shadowlands
They sometimes attack the city, Yi Ti or just anyone who wanders into the shadowlands

Mountainous area to the north, stretches out super far.
Rumors: 
Demons and dragons dwell in the cliff caves
Heart of the shadowlands, called Stygai

East of the city, no light in this part of the city
Torch lit up at entrance to dark alleyway
Long red haired woman wearing red robes
Gold choker with a ruby engraved into it

Fellow lord of light follower
She's Lady Melisandre

Red hair, kissed by fire.

Down the road, shadowbinders reside.
Rarely leave the city, but might be able to help us some other way.

Do not know the dangers we will be put in
Not meant to be reopened

Can provide us with protection against the curse of the old ones so that our minds do not frenzy 
Gods live beneath the cities, after being conquered by the jade emperor the cities were sealed off forever

Silver lord thinks he'll be able to have riches beyond count and knows the evils will 

[[Rychar Lazarys]] stayed behind because of _morals_
Lead Mago down to the alleyway
Blink and he's gone
Door opens and candle is lit
Closes behind us

Couple of tables and trays
Paintbrush and vials of paint

Shadowy voice saying to remove our clothing and lay on the table
Backs start being painted on
Burns slightly

Will last till the turn of the next moon
Protects us from the evil magic beneath Leng

[[Fyrelis Lazarys]] and [[Chandra Nalaar]] hear voices, only them
Potential is strong within us, give life in service to the shadows for 
Stay within Asshai and get taught their arts

Tour guide showing us around the jungle:
Greast citadel last empress of Leng

Guards ahead around a temple
Defeated guards after a failed sneak

Massive bar covering the door and locks
Warnings to not enter.
Picked lock in
Opened to screeching sounds and darkness with stairs down

Another door at bottom of stairs
Very well preserved city past door

Hear gravelly footsteps
Massive boom like a drum beat

Voice in the unprotected people's head yelling "Kill, kill kill"
Humanoid creature tackles person that was running away
Starts eating the body
Looks like a person, no moisture so super shrunken skin
