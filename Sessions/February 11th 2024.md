Heading to [[Qarth]]

Close to Valyria

House of the undying
Pale men with blue lips

Approach the great palace of [[Qarth]]

Unsullied guards with chains around their necks
Made a sacrifice of an unsullied body part

At the feast of qarth

He destroyed their weapons and shield
He lost :(

Going to house of the undying
 - Supposed to show you your greatest desire
[[Myat Nee]] house of undying representative from the feast

Long tall building coiled like serpent, no windows
Black barked tree
Black tiles cover the roof

Thick blue liquid

Must keep entering the first door on the right, or else

Within the price is the experiences.

 - Dead ahead is giant black dragon
	 - Multiple heads, several cut off.
	 - Giant Crow feasting on the body
 - One on center
 - One eye has been shut
 - Third eye glaring at us

We all pull ourselves out individually
Except [[Fyrelis Lazarys]] and [[Rychar Lazarys]]
We're in capy cove
Dead bodies all around

Family keep is on fire
Massacre in the building
Teenager around the age of [[Rychar Lazarys]] beheaded
Around bearded man holding a baby throws it out the window
[[Rychar Lazarys]] father is the bearded man

Illegitimate child (?)

Cradle snaps around him
Falls out
Wakes up in a new place not as decorated as before
Got picked up by bearded man

[[Chandra Nalaar]] sees campfire around snow filled area

[[Bartimaeus Storm]] crowns in room, gets knighted by skeleton group


New void, bunch of doors in circle
Doors expand out for like ever

In a chamber room with 13 humanoid figures around us
Spectral 

Have seen what has been and what will be
Now wants to show us now

Face pillars of strength from your life to get a vision 

Fighting Dream versions of:
Oras Lazyrus 
Morro Bior - [[Rychar Lazarys]] combat teacher

Hear something that sounds like clapping when we finish
Voices come once more

Path will take us to the sunken city where the scourge lies

## Scourge will take our bodies and minds unless protected by those that control the shadows

Wake up outside the doors ready to enter as if we had never entered the building.
The undying ones are pleased

Night time, head back to ship
