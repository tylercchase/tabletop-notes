Still at tournament
[[Bartholomew]] is out of session
Want to try starting a fight between [[House Braken]] and [[House Blackwood]]

Killed a [[House Blackwood]] guard and wrote [[House Braken]] was here on the body
[[Lord Braken]] got an injury from the night before, should be good for us in the free for, few guards died
Bradley stole the guard's coin purse
Finally moved pavilions away from each other

Some melee participants = 
[[Sir Roger Rain]] note to self it is Ser Roger Reyne for spelling
[[Sir Arlan of Pennytree]]
[[Sir Quentin Ball]] 

Slipped some laxative poison into [[Sir Quentin Ball]] drink
[[Hedge Knights]] - homeless knight basically

Smoke rising from one of the towers
[[Serrin]] is on a horse waiting for the guards

[[Serrin]] got away but not without a bunch of wounds

On one of the horses has a shield
Sigil is of a white ship on a black background
Nobody knows who that is
