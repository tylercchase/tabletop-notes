Still at tournament
[[Bartholomew]] is out of session
Want to try starting a fight between [[House Braken]] and [[House Blackwood]]

Killed a [[House Blackwood]] guard and wrote [[House Braken]] was here on the body
[[Lord Braken]] got an injury from the night before, should be good for us in the free for, few guards died
Finally moved pavilions away from each other

Some melee participants = 
[[Sir Roger Rain]]
[[Sir Arlan of Pennytree]]
[[Sir Quentin Ball]] 

Slipped some laxative poison into [[Sir Quentin Ball]] drink
[[Hedge Knigh]]
