[[Rychar Lazarys]] needs to catch a cat for his acrobatic combat training?

Peasants damming up the stream, knights came over and said it wasn't their stream and cut this peasants face
They said lord Arol was in charge of the river

Lord says that the peasants were not permitted to build a dam and that river is actually Lord Arol's 

One of our knights told the peasants to build the dam
Very old and gave the peasants coin to do the work

Taking a series of troops to lord arol
Making the impression that they should have talked to us not gone after our peasants

Negotiate for peace and inflict similar injuries to them.

[[Lord arol]] is young, might be itching for a fight.
Need to impress we are not weak

Going to haystack hall.
Get there around midday and the castle is about the same size as ours and has been around for a few generations
On top of a hill.

Told to mind ourselves as we enter.
Met by man in a robe, maestar of the house
Man in armor, knight.

Meeting with the lord in his castle
Teenager (16 years old)

Sir Dantos storms off,
Their Maestar is looking into it

Our lord goes over to talk with them

Captain Aron runs in with a note
[[Rychar Lazarys]] mother, sister's ship has been attacked by a ship
Got word requesting a ransom
