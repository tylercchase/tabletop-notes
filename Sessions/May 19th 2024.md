### In King's Landing

Lot of people stuck outside, more guards than normal
Gates Closed

Goldcloak wants to talk to us in private (away from aegor) , dude with us is told "His brother will know what is gonna be talked about"

Comes to us on behalf of master of whispers
Reason to believe the griffin is real and here

House Morwen, house of Serrin

The last member of the house is the Vulture King and The Griffin
Reports of him being an old man are accurate

Rest of the city watch is compromised
Few months ago guild of alchemist was moving wildfyre and caches were stolen
Security tightened up but still not found

Hunt down those responsible and capture those responsible
If it goes off large parts of the city gets destroyed

Plan is get [[Bartimaeus Storm]] and [[Bobbiel Larzin]] to be 'fired' and 'join' the bad house

Approached by people and taken to old dragon pits
Secret stairs that go deep into the pits

People there
Have to have hands bound
Cult like setup

Old dude in lots of armor shows up
all silver hair

Two dudes show up
	Arthur Moorewind
	Sir Jason Water - dude that was doing fraud in kings landing 
		Working with the moorewinds
Talking a lot about the "Chains of Nobility"
By the end of the moon (a month) bring [[Rychar Lazarys]] to them alive to kill there

Wants them to kill the rest of the party
To guarantee that he does it, [[Bobbiel Larzin]] is gonna stay there as collateral
Has a guarded stash of pots neatly organized full of wildfyre, threatens to use it if anything fishy happens
