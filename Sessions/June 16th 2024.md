Lord of light convince play?
They don't like nobles
They don't like us since we took over their houses' area

Stray cat following us, 
Into the dragon pit with peoples

Take out iron throne
New government
No nobility, rule by merit

Blood sacrifice to mark the new age.
Level half the city, little bit more and can level all

Miles of tunnels underneath the city

Guard next to the table helps us get out

Lord bloodraven, master of whispers person

Knew where wyldfire was here, but didn't have ability to get rid of guards first

Goldcloaks are here

Man in horseback with red birthmark on his face shows up, pale, long silver hair, gold jewelry, sigil pin of silver dragon

Last 2 attempts failed they left before they arrived.

Goin' to the red keep, 
gonna visit the maestar for burn marks on legs
