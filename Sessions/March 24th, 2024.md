Planning on hiring/ coercing (Master of the house style) Sir Arlan of Pennytree
King - not attending (sent a nice letter but no gift ;-;)
Lord aron (neighbor) - Brought food for the feast
Rychar - bow of the sumer isles

Sir boros barathian

Jane Dondarean - Rychar's bride
Brienne Tarth - lynel's bride

Possibly poisoning sir boros
Ended up poising lynel and boros
Lynel dies, boros didn't feel a thing from poison

Visiting body after death during night
Serrin shows up

6 years old at the time
Older brother fell in love with a person from house barathian
Uncle of [[Bartimaeus Storm]]
[[Bartimaeus Storm]] mother still alive - living with the silent sisters

Uncle didn't want him coming there
Disgraceful nature of disrupting the wedding
Serrin - great uncle named Arthur
Doesn't care about the rightful seat to the throne
Only wants the people here dead

Serrin is dead

Rat in the room watching us (possible greensight user)

Wandering minstrels disappeared - probably Serrin's men
Weapons and poison hidden in the instruments
