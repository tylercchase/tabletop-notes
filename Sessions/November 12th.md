Maestar has looked over a bunch of 

House in stormlands

second day travelling
things have changed
bodies have been hung
hamlet is empty 20-40 people gone
peasant's are the ones that have been hanged
drained of blood

Family was in a house
Mom and dad with faces torn off
Lots of horse tracks
going heading south west
Dogs have died :'(

Going through the houses

Finally hear something when going into a house
Something underneath a bed

Old man under the bed 70 years old
Massive beard

Hid underneath the floorboards
Madmens came?
Started talking about their lord
Answer lies in the blood

Lord of the blood
Took everyone and killed people and animals
There this morning
Came at sunrise

Brought people into center and asked them to accept the blood

Putting the old man underneath the floorboards and dragging a dresser over him to keep him locked away


Following the tracks of horses and peasants

Got here at afternoon and it is now nighttime

A massive fire in the distance
More people hanged in the treelines
Actively bleeding blood

Old man in front of the fire (NOT THE ONE WE TRAPPED)
preaching in front of the fire to the peasants

Man soaking in blood
about 6 other cultists around the fire
hide armor on them and all equipped with battle axes or hand axes

"look how the blood makes him even stronger" - old man
Old man locks in on [[Bartholomew]] 
Saying the lord of light challenges him.

Massive dude bathed in blood
The idol is dead

6 cultists
2 are out of it because they're convinced

Burned 2 cultist for the lord of light
Commenced a sermon to recruit the peasants 

Saved the peasants to bring back to the village

Cultists have an axe and handaxe
And breastplate armor from the idol of blood

20 rescued half kids

Taking them back to our town [[Capycove]]
+1 population

Burning down the village
Had to convince kid that his dad's voice was a sign from the lord of light

Vision:
Ocean and white ship
Crow's nest and baby crow hawking at me and making eye contact with me


+20 experience and 1 glory
